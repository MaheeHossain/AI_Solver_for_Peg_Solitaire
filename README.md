# AI_Solver_for_Peg_Solitaire
University assignment for COMP20003

This was a project done in 2020 which used the C language, and improved skills in data structures (hash table, linked list, stack), memory management, 
algorithms traversing graphs, and testing. We are given a pre-made [Peg Solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire) game, and we have to build an algorithm to 
solve each level. The algorithm is then tested, and a report is written on the outcome.
